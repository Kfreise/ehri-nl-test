{{< intro >}}
The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)](https://www.ehri-project.eu) is an international 
infrastructure securing Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a trans-national level. 
EHRI-NL is the national node representing the Netherlands within this international research consortium.
{{< /intro >}}

### EHRI-NL will seek to ensure the long-term sustainability of Holocaust research within the Netherlands and beyond by:

 * representing institutions within the Netherlands which contain materials related to Holocaust
   Studies to create a strong research consortium;
 * connecting resources through a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure;
 * developing innovative digital research tools;
 * offering fellowships and training opportunities for researchers, archivists, and heritage professionals.

EHRI's impact is primarily scientific, however, the infrastructure also advances a wider
social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive
nationalisms in Europe and beyond demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely
academic concern, but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across
Europe and beyond.
